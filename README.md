## Installation and use

Use the common macOS, Linux or Windows installer from the repository root to
install the R library and CLI together. Follow the
[installation and CLI guide](https://averrik.github.io/NGR/articles/cli.html).
Runtime commands load the installed package and do not install dependencies.

The repository is private. Public documentation is on
[GitHub Pages](https://averrik.github.io/NGR/).

Open the RStudio project inside `lib/` for package development.
